    <!-- Stage 1 -->
    <string name="tutorialText">Tutorial</string>
    <string name="tutorialIntro">Blacksmith</string>
    <string name="tutorialIntroText">Welcome to Blacksmith! This short tutorial will help you get started, and you\'ll be blacksmithing in no time.</string>
    <string name="tutorialCoins">Coins</string>
    <string name="tutorialCoinsText">Your coins are used for buying... well, everything. They are earned by trading away items.</string>
    <string name="tutorialQuest">Quests</string>
    <string name="tutorialQuestText">This is your current quest (if any). Quests are an excellent way to earn extra resources.</string>
    <string name="tutorialLevel">Level</string>
    <string name="tutorialLevelText">This is your current level. XP is earned by crafting and trading items.</string>
    <string name="tutorialVisitor">Visitor</string>
    <string name="tutorialVisitorText">Your first visitor has arrived! Tap him to continue.</string>

    <!-- Stage 2 -->
    <string name="tutorialVisitorPicture">Visitor</string>
    <string name="tutorialVisitorPictureText">Ah, Mr T Utorial! How nice of you to stop by.</string>
    <string name="tutorialVisitorPrefs">Preferences</string>
    <string name="tutorialVisitorPrefsText">It looks like this visitor prefers bronze items, and ore, and gives a 5% bonus if they are traded.</string>
    <string name="tutorialVisitorDemands">Demands</string>
    <string name="tutorialVisitorDemandsText">Each visitor has a list of demands. This one is for ores, tap the red button to open the trading window and see available items in your inventory.</string>

    <!-- Stage 3 -->
    <string name="tutorialTradeItems">Tradeable Items</string>
    <string name="tutorialTradeItemsText">Looks like you\'ve got 3 different ores to sell. How lucky! Sell any, and you\'ll get more than the coins listed due to the visitor\'s ore preference.</string>
    <string name="tutorialTradeFinish">Finish Trading</string>
    <string name="tutorialTradeFinishText">Once any 2 ores have been traded, tap finish to return to the visitor overview.</string>

    <!-- Stage 4 -->
    <string name="tutorialVisitorDemandsLeft">Demands</string>
    <string name="tutorialVisitorDemandsLeftText">Hmm, looks like he also wants an unfinished item, and a finished item. We haven\'t got those yet!</string>
    <string name="tutorialVisitorClose">Close</string>
    <string name="tutorialVisitorCloseText">Let\'s leave the visitor, and make our way to the furnace to make some bronze bars.</string>

    <!-- Stage 5 -->
    <string name="tutorialFurnaceSlots">Slots</string>
    <string name="tutorialFurnaceSlotsText">Any bars that are currently being smelted in the furnace will appear here. If there\'s no space, bars will be queued up.</string>
    <string name="tutorialFurnace">Furnace</string>
    <string name="tutorialFurnaceText">Time to open up the furnace, and make a bar for Mr T Utorial.</string>

    <!-- Stage 6 -->
    <string name="tutorialFurnaceItems">Item</string>
    <string name="tutorialFurnaceItemsText">Item information is shown here. Generally, item information can only be seen after being created, but the bronze bar has been unlocked for you.</string>
    <string name="tutorialFurnaceScroll">Changing Items</string>
    <string name="tutorialFurnaceScrollText">Swiping left and right or tapping the item image will change between available items. For now though, they\'ll mostly be hidden.</string>
    <string name="tutorialFurnaceIngredients">Ingredients</string>
    <string name="tutorialFurnaceIngredientsText">Since this is a rather basic item, it only requires level 1. It also requires copper and tin ore, which we have plenty of.</string>
    <string name="tutorialFurnaceSmelt">Smelting</string>
    <string name="tutorialFurnaceSmeltText">Craft a few bronze bars, we\'ll need them for the unfinished items.</string>
    <string name="tutorialFurnaceClose">Close</string>
    <string name="tutorialFurnaceCloseText">Close the furnace, and we\'ll make our way to the anvil.</string>

    <!-- Stage 7 -->
    <string name="tutorialMainAnvil">Anvil</string>
    <string name="tutorialMainAnvilText">To make the bronze bars into the unfinished dagger, we only need to visit the anvil. As before, notice there\'s only 1 slot available for now.</string>

    <!-- Stage 8 -->
    <string name="tutorialAnvil">Items</string>
    <string name="tutorialAnvilText">As in the furnace, all items are currently hidden except a basic bronze dagger. Luckily, that\'s what we need to make.</string>
    <string name="tutorialAnvilUp">Tiers</string>
    <string name="tutorialAnvilUpText">Unlike the furnace, there are different tiers of item in the anvil. Bronze is the lowest, then iron, all the way up to dragon and legendary items.</string>
    <string name="tutorialAnvilIngredients">Ingredients</string>
    <string name="tutorialAnvilIngredientsText">Hopefully, you\'ve got plenty of bronze bars made from the furnace. If not, better go back and make them!</string>
    <string name="tutorialAnvilCraft">Crafting</string>
    <string name="tutorialAnvilCraftText">Make a couple of unfinished bronze daggers. Notice that you gain XP for every crafted item.</string>

    <!-- Stage 9 -->
    <string name="tutorialMainTable">Table</string>
    <string name="tutorialMainTableText">To turn those unfinished daggers into finished daggers, we need to go to the table.</string>

    <!-- Stage 10 -->
    <string name="tutorialTable">Table</string>
    <string name="tutorialTableText">The table is similar to the anvil, but combines unfinished items and secondary ingredients to make finished items.</string>
    <string name="tutorialTableIngredients">Ingredients</string>
    <string name="tutorialTableIngredientsText">To finish up the dagger, we need a spidersilk. Luckily, we have plenty!</string>
    <string name="tutorialTableCraft">Craft</string>
    <string name="tutorialTableCraftText">Craft one, and the dagger will be ready in a second or so.</string>

    <!-- Stage 11 -->
    <string name="tutorialMainVisitorFinish">Finishing</string>
    <string name="tutorialMainVisitorFinishText">Now, let\'s go give the visitor all of his items.</string>

    <!-- Stage 12 -->
    <string name="tutorialVisitorFinishBtn">Complete</string>
    <string name="tutorialVisitorFinishBtnText">Once all the items have been handed in, press the complete button. You\'ll get a tip from the visitor as a thank you!</string>
    <string name="tutorialVisitorFinish">Demands</string>
    <string name="tutorialVisitorFinishText">Now, give the visitor the rest of his items via the trade screens.</string>

    <!-- Stage 13 -->
    <string name="tutorialMainInfo">Last Thing</string>
    <string name="tutorialMainInfoText">Almost finished. Before you give Mr T his items, we\'ll just cover a couple more key areas, then you can explore the game and figure it out yourself.</string>
    <string name="tutorialMainWorker">Worker</string>
    <string name="tutorialMainWorkerText">Later on in the game, workers can be hired to find resources for you. For now though...</string>
    <string name="tutorialMainMarket">Market</string>
    <string name="tutorialMainMarketText">Whilst resources can be earned by completing visitors, most of your resources will come from buying things from traders in the market.\nTap to enter.</string>

    <!-- Stage 14 -->
    <string name="tutorialMarket">Market</string>
    <string name="tutorialMarketText">This is where your resources will come from! Traders will come and go over time, and purchasing from them will unlock better / more items for sale.</string>
    <string name="tutorialMarketClose">Close</string>
    <string name="tutorialMarketCloseText">The tutorial is almost over! Close the market, and we\'ll take a look at the last few areas.</string>

    <!-- Stage 15 -->
    <string name="tutorialMainSettings">Settings</string>
    <string name="tutorialMainSettingsText">Sounds, music, and notifications can be turned on &amp; off here, and the tutorial can be replayed. A message history is also available, along with optional google play achievements, leaderboards, and cloud saves.</string>
    <string name="tutorialMainInventory">Inventory</string>
    <string name="tutorialMainInventoryText">All of your items can be seen here, and sold if necessary. It\'s a good way to keep track of everything!</string>
    <string name="tutorialMainHelp">Help</string>
    <string name="tutorialMainHelpText">The tutorial is over! If you get stuck, you can tap the "Help" icon on any screen to get more information, or replay the tutorial from the settings menu. Happy blacksmithing!</string>

        <item>A Helper with a Pickaxe, Hammer, or Ring will gather materials worth more Coins than the other Tools. But sometimes you really need the materials the other Tools provide.</item>
        <item>Equipping a Helper with a better Tool will produce better results. Craft or buy higher Tier Tools to get higher Tier materials.</item>
        <item>Once you\'ve equipped a Helper with a Tool, you can press the display to the right of the Tool to get a list of how many items they will gather.</item>
        <item>Everyone does a better job when they aren\'t hungry! Your Workers included. Give your Helper a Food item to increase how much they will gather.</item>
        <item>The Foods that you craft may provide a higher Helper gather bonus than the Foods you can buy in the Market.</item>
        <item>Each Helper has a different secret Food that they prefer and that provides a double gather bonus. Once you\'ve discovered their preferred Food, the gather bonus will be displayed in a green color.</item>
        <item>Providing your Helpers with Food gives a small chance that they will bring back a special Page item. Using their preferred Food increases this chance.</item>
