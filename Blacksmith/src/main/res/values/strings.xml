    <string name="help_advertising">Advertising</string>
    <string name="help_text_advertising">There are 2 types of advert in Pixel Blacksmith.\nThe first is a \'convenience\' one, e.g. skipping a timer, getting a free restock. The other type is the \'bonus\' advert, accessible via the bonus chest.\nThis chest can only be opened every few hours (premium members have a shorter timer).\nPremium members can also disable adverts. If this option is selected, all mention of adverts will be removed.</string>
    <string name="help_overview">Overview</string>
    <string name="help_text_overview">So, here\'s the deal: You\'re a blacksmith. A not very good one, to be honest.\nIf you want to make a name for yourself, you\'re going to have to keep visitors happy, and keep an eye on your resources.\nOr, I guess you could ignore all the visitors and just work towards making the high end gear. But, y\'know, don\'t do that.\nGenerally, ores come from the market and other ingredients come from visitors and certain traders. You can also hire workers to gather resources for you.\nThese ores are smelted in the furnace, crafted at the anvil, finished at the table, and embedded with gems at the gem table, before being sold to a visitor.\nVisitors, like the rest of us, have preferences. Once a visitor has been sold one of their favourite types / tiers / states of item, their preference and associated bonus will be saved.\nNext time they visit, selling them preferred items will provide a nice healthy bonus tip for yourself.\nGet stuck at any stage in the process? Press the help button!</string>
    <string name="help_furnace">Furnace</string>
    <string name="help_text_furnace">The furnace is the starting point for creating items.\nOre is generally bought from passing traders at the marketplace, but it can also be given as a reward by happy visitors.\nOre you receive will have to be smelted into bars before any items can be created with it. Some bars will require a mixer, generally coal, to facilitate the creation of bars.\nWhilst bars can be sold, they\'ll generally be a lot more valuable if they are first hammered into an unfinished item via the anvil, and finally finished at the crafting table.\nFood can also be created here. This can be sold to visitors, or given to workers to increase resources returned / increase the chance of pages.\nSwipe left and right to change items. Pressing \'Smelt 10\' will add 10 bars to your smelting queue, if you have the resources.</string>
    <string name="help_anvil">Anvil</string>
    <string name="help_text_anvil">After the furnace creates bars, the anvil must be used to hammer them into shape.\nMost recipes only require bars, with more valuable items requiring more bars.\nOf course, these unfinished items aren\'t quite done yet. They will still require combining with a secondary ingredient, which is done at the crafting table.\nRings can also be crafted via the separate \'Rings\' tab.\nSwipe left and right to change items. Use the up and down arrows to change tiers.\nPressing \'10\' will add 10 of the item to your crafting queue, if you have the resources.</string>
    <string name="help_inventory">Inventory</string>
    <string name="help_text_inventory">All of your current stock can be viewed here.\nMost items can be sold for their basic value here, although this is not recommended. Note that any prestige / coins bonus will not apply here.\nInstead, try and create items that will sell for a large bonus with visitors.\nLong pressing an item will mark it as unsellable, useful when saving items.\nIf a page has "Exc" next to it, it can be exchanged for a random page. This can be useful when trying to get the last few pages for a book.\nScroll up and down to view all items.</string>
    <string name="help_food">Food Selection</string>
    <string name="help_text_food">Helpers can be given food here.\nEach worker has a favourite food, and if it has been used in the past it will be highlighted here with green text and double the usual bonus.\nTrying different foods with helpers to find their favourite is a good way to maximise bonus resources.</string>
    <string name="help_credits">Credits</string>
    <string name="help_text_credits">Making a game is hard, but it\'s also extremely rewarding and educational.\nDevelopment would be impossible without building on the work of others via open-source libraries, free resources, and places like StackOverflow.\nThe credits contain a few of the larger contributions, but the helpfulness of the hundreds of articles / forums / Q&amp;A sites visited during development can\'t be understated.\nThanks, y\'all!</string>
    <string name="help_gem">Gem Table</string>
    <string name="help_text_gem">Once an item is finished, its value can be greatly increased by putting a valuable gem inside.\nUse these wisely, as they are only available in limited quantities, and certain visitors will pay a very hefty bonus for items with their preferred gem in.\nGems can also be crushed into powders via the \'Powder\' tab.\nAs always, swipe left and right to change items, and use the up and down arrows to change tiers.\nOnce the desired item is selected, tap the gem to be added.</string>
    <string name="help_market">Market</string>
    <string name="help_text_market">Raw resources (ore, some secondaries) are generally purchased from the market. Traders come and go, each with different specialities.\nOnly traders with stock will be displayed, so buying all stock from more common traders is a good way to get rarer traders.\nIf a lot of purchases are made from a trader, more items will unlock for sale.\nScroll up and down to see the full list of traders.\nIf all traders are out of stock, you\'ll have to wait for the market to restock, or pay a bribe / watch an advert to get them all to come back immediately.\nTraders can also be locked in place for a fee, ensuring vital resources can always be purchased (for an increased price).</string>
    <string name="help_settings">Settings</string>
    <string name="help_text_settings">Game settings can be changed here, changes take place as soon as the settings interface is closed.\nSound Options:\nHere all game sounds, game music, and notification sounds can be enabled / disabled.\nNotification Options:\nMarket restock, visitor spawn, worker return, items crafted, and bonus chest refill notifications can be enabled / disabled.\nGameplay Options:\n\'Full Screen\' enables a more immersive full screen mode.\nThe \'Quick Select\' functionality allows tapping the item image in a crafting interface to change item.

    <string name="help_trader">Trader</string>
    <string name="help_text_trader">Various traders will appear in the market, each offering different items. Making many purchases from a trader will usually unlock more items for sale.\nMany traders require a minimum level before they will appear, especially those selling higher level / rarer equipment.\nThey each have a limited amount of stock and restocking happens every 24 hours. Time until next restock is available on the statistics interface, and a notification is also sent.\nA trader can also be restocked for a cost. The buy all button will also buy every item the trader is currently selling.\nLocked traders restock for free, but charge higher prices.</string>
    <string name="help_statistics">Statistics</string>
    <string name="help_text_statistics">Useful statistics such as time until next restock / visitor are available here.\nAdditionally, progress towards various achievements can be tracked using the statistics displayed, as well as other miscellaneous pieces of information.\nCompletion percentage is also visible here. Many factors contribute to this percentage:\n- Level\n- Upgrades\n- Traders unlocked\n- Trader stocks unlocked\n- Slots unlocked\n- Items seen\n- Visitor preferences discovered\n- Trophies unlocked\n- Helpers purchased\nNote that every prestige (Level 70+) counts as an additional 100%.\nTotal coin percentage is calculated as: Coins Upgrade + (0.5 * Prestige Level)), then converted from a multiplier into a percentage.\nTotal XP percentage is calculated as: XP Upgrade * (0.75 ^ Prestige Level)), then converted from a multiplier into a percentage.</string>
    <string name="help_table">Table</string>
    <string name="help_text_table">The table is an essential part of the item creating process, converting unfinished items into finished items, with the addition of secondary ingredients.\nAfter this, items can be optionally embedded with gems at the gem table.\nAdditionally, rare pages can be crafted into books here. Crafting a book will require 10 pages, and many additional ingredients. Pages are obtained from a variety of sources:\n- 3 pages are rewarded when a visitor trophy is unlocked.\n- 35%% chance to receive one when opening the bonus chest.\n- 0-90%% chance to receive one from a worker, depending on food used (see worker help for more info).\nSwipe left and right to change items. Use the up and down arrows to change tiers.</string>
    <string name="help_trade">Trade</string>
    <string name="help_text_trade">This screen is where you\'ll make all of your money!\nThe discovered bonus is displayed next to the sell price of each item. It\'s entirely possible the item will sell for more than this, if all of the visitor\'s preferences have not yet been discovered.\nUndiscovered preferences will be displayed as \"???\".\nIf an item has been sold to a visitor in the past, it will be shown in grey to make it easier to work out preference.\nThe progress bar will let you see your progress at a glance, and the item criteria and visitor are also visible.\nThe finish button will close this trade for now.\nThe \'Max\' button will, when checked, let you trade as many of an item as possible at once.\nLong pressing an item will mark it as unsellable, useful when saving items.</string>
    <string name="help_trophy">Trophy</string>
    <string name="help_text_trophy">The trophy screen is where notes about all of the seen visitors can be looked at.\nUnseen visitors will have no information available about them.\nSeen visitors will have a lighter silhouette the more you see them. Additionally, basic information will become available.\nOnce a visitor has been seen 100 times, they will provide you with a gift, and become fully visible.\nThe higher the \'Appear chance\', the more likely a visitor is to arrive.</string>
    <string name="help_visitor">Visitor</string>
    <string name="help_text_visitor">This screen provides an overview of the currently selected visitor.\nOnce a visitor\'s preferred item type, tier, or state have been discovered through trading, this will be displayed underneath the visitor\'s picture. Also shown is how much extra a visitor will pay for these preferences. Combine all three to achieve the biggest profits!\nItem type: This is the item\'s category. For example dagger, sword, or hatchet.\nItem tier: This is the quality of the item\'s material. For example bronze, iron, or steel.\nItem state: This is the condition of the item. For example unfinished (shattered vial icon) or normal (vial icon). At higher levels, this can be an embedded gem such as red (ruby icon) or blue (sapphire icon).\nAdditionally, the highest value item previously traded with the visitor is displayed.\nIn the list of demands, black denotes a required trade, whilst grey is optional.\nOnce all required trades have been completed, the visitor can be completed and you will receive a reward. If all of the visitor\'s optional demands have also been completed, you\'ll receive double the reward!\nAlternatively, they can be shooed away for a fee. This fee is based on your current level, how long the visitor has been waiting, and the number of incomplete demands (required + optional).</string>
    <string name="help_upgrade">Upgrade</string>
    <string name="help_text_upgrade">On this screen various upgrades can be bought, to help improve your shop.\nCraft Time\nUpgrading craft time will decrease the amount of time each item takes.

    <string name="help_premium">Premium</string>
    <string name="help_text_premium">Buying premium provides a ton of new features and helps further development on the game!\nOnce premium, you\'ll also be able to prestige, essentially starting a new game with +50%% coin earnings and -25%% XP gain.\nThere\'s also extremely valuable legendary items, a reduced cooldown on the bonus chest, and many more features!\nAmong the benefits is a tax paid by all out of stock traders when an automatic restock happens. Think of it as a reward for being a loyal customer!\nNote that premium status is applied to your account forever, and any other devices you install Pixel Blacksmith on will also be made premium.\nContributions\nContributing is a way to continue helping the games\'s development. Contributing repeatedly will provide extra benefits such as suggesting new items and visitors!</string>
    <string name="help_messages">Messages</string>
    <string name="help_text_messages">The last 100 important messages are displayed here.\nCommon messages, such as crafting beginning will not be displayed, but rarer ones like levelling up will. This way, if a message is missed, it can be reviewed here.\nBy default, tapping a message will close it. The \'Quick Log Access\' setting will change this to open the messages interface instead.</string>
    <string name="help_helper">Helper</string>
    <string name="help_text_helper">Helpers help gather resources. Every helper has a minimum level, and a hire cost based on that level.\nOnce a helper has been hired, they will gather resources for you over time.\nThe resources gained depends on the tool used. Higher tier tools will gather more / better resources.\nProviding a helper with food will provide bonus resources and provide a chance of finding a page.\nEach helper has a favourite food, which will provide twice the normal bonus if provided. Food is consumed on each trip.\nIf \'Auto-feed\' is enabled, helpers (and heroes) will automatically restock themselves if the last used food is available.\nTapping the \'Send Out Helpers\' button will send out all available helpers / heroes.\nTapping a purchased helper will tell you their name, total trips, and current food item.\nTapping the food item will let you pick another. Discovered favourite food(s) are highlighted in green, and provide double food bonuses + page chance.\nTapping the tool will let you to choose another, based on items you currently own.\nTapping the resource indicator will provide information on the resources currently being gathered.\nThe large button below the helper sends them out to gather resources. Additionally, tapping the button whilst the helper is busy will display the exact time until they return.</string>
    <string name="help_hero">Hero</string>
    <string name="help_text_hero">Heroes are hireable workers who can be given equipment, and sent on adventures.\nThe higher a hero\'s strength, the more likely they are to succeed. The %% chance of success is displayed on the Start Adventure button.\nIf hero strength = adventure difficulty, there is a 50%% chance of success. If hero strength >= 2x adventure difficulty, success is guaranteed.\nAdditionally if success is guaranteed, bonus items will be rewarded from the adventure, between 1.1-2.5x the normal amount.\nIf a hero fails an adventure, they will lose a random 1-3 pieces of equipment. As such, be careful not to send heroes on unwinnable adventures.</string>
    <string name="help_tools">Tools</string>
    <string name="help_text_tools">Select a tool for a helper to use by first selecting a category, then an item.\nOnly currently owned items will be displayed. Note that higher tier tools will provide better / more resources.\nTools do not degrade, and can be reclaimed by providing the helper with a replacement tool.</string>
    <string name="help_quest">Quests</string>
    <string name="help_text_quest">Quests are an excellent way to gather additional rewards whilst playing.\nOnce a quest is accepted, the relevant icon and current progress will appear in the indicator. If multiple are selected, the next to end will be displayed.\nA list of accepted / upcoming / completed / failed quests is available, as well as a schedule of all events.\nAll quests reward XP, 0-2 pages, and 2-24 items / 50-2100 coins.\nXP is calculated by multiplier * current level. The values for the multiplier are: Easy 9, Medium 15, Hard 35, Elite 75.\nPage chance is 25%% for Easy, 50%% for Medium, 100%% for Hard, and 200%% for Elite (2 pages!).\nThe number of items / coins rewarded is halved for Easy, unchanged for Medium, doubled for Hard, and tripled for Elite.\nAccepted quests (except contribution quests) will give a reminder notification (via Google Play Games) 24 hours before the end.</string>
    <string name="help_item_picker">Quick Select</string>
    <string name="help_text_item_picker">When the "Quick Select" setting is enabled, tapping an item will display a list of all items in the current tier.\nTapping any item image / name will load it into the crafting interface, and this can often be faster than swiping to the area.\nWhen this option is enabled, swiping to change item can be trickier, so some players may wish to disable it via the settings menu for easier swiping.\nAdditionally, the "Show All Items" toggle will switch between only displaying creatable items, and displaying all items.</string>
    <string name="help_hero_adventures">Adventures</string>
    <string name="help_text_hero_adventures">Adventures can be selected for your hero to go on.\nThey are organised into categories and subcategories. Quests with a higher difficulty generally offer better rewards, but your hero is more likely to fail!</string>
    <string name="help_hero_equipment">Equipment</string>
    <string name="help_text_hero_equipment">Any item of the correct type can be given to a hero.\nHowever, taking notice of their preferences will ensure the most efficient tools are selected.\nDiscovering unique item sets will provide a free strength increase, useful for defeating the harder quests.</string>
    <string name="help_hero_visitors">Visitors</string>
    <string name="help_text_hero_visitors">A list of all visitors is here, along with progress towards unlocking them.\nOnce the requirements have been met, they can be selected as a hero.\nSelecting heroes with high preference bonuses is a good way to increase total strength.</string>

    <string name="help_text_super_upgrade">Super upgrades are much more powerful upgrades that can only be used by players that have completed a collection.\nCollections can be created from books in the \'Books\' tab of the crafting table.\nPrestiging will unlock more Super Upgrades, whilst completing collections will increase the maximum that can be enabled at once.\n\'100x Contribution Reward\' increases the 1337 coins usually received by contributing to a staggering 133,700 coins.\n\'Free Market Restock\' makes restocking the market and traders free, perfect for emptying traders out!\n\'2x ____ Items\' doubles the number of items received from a crafting process.

    <!-- Stage 1 -->
    <string name="tutorialText">Tutorial</string>
    <string name="tutorialIntro">Blacksmith</string>
    <string name="tutorialIntroText">Welcome to Blacksmith! This short tutorial will help you get started, and you\'ll be blacksmithing in no time.</string>
    <string name="tutorialCoins">Coins</string>
    <string name="tutorialCoinsText">Your coins are used for buying... well, everything. They are earned by trading away items.</string>
    <string name="tutorialQuest">Quests</string>
    <string name="tutorialQuestText">This is your current quest (if any). Quests are an excellent way to earn extra resources.</string>
    <string name="tutorialLevel">Level</string>
    <string name="tutorialLevelText">This is your current level. XP is earned by crafting and trading items.</string>
    <string name="tutorialVisitor">Visitor</string>
    <string name="tutorialVisitorText">Your first visitor has arrived! Tap him to continue.</string>

    <!-- Stage 2 -->
    <string name="tutorialVisitorPicture">Visitor</string>
    <string name="tutorialVisitorPictureText">Ah, Mr T Utorial! How nice of you to stop by.</string>
    <string name="tutorialVisitorPrefs">Preferences</string>
    <string name="tutorialVisitorPrefsText">It looks like this visitor prefers bronze items, and ore, and gives a 5%% bonus if they are traded.</string>
    <string name="tutorialVisitorDemands">Demands</string>
    <string name="tutorialVisitorDemandsText">Each visitor has a list of demands. This one is for ores, tap the red button to open the trading window and see available items in your inventory.</string>

    <!-- Stage 3 -->
    <string name="tutorialTradeItems">Tradeable Items</string>
    <string name="tutorialTradeItemsText">Looks like you\'ve got 3 different ores to sell. How lucky! Sell any, and you\'ll get more than the coins listed due to the visitor\'s ore preference.</string>
    <string name="tutorialTradeFinish">Finish Trading</string>
    <string name="tutorialTradeFinishText">Once any 2 ores have been traded, tap finish to return to the visitor overview.</string>

    <!-- Stage 4 -->
    <string name="tutorialVisitorDemandsLeft">Demands</string>
    <string name="tutorialVisitorDemandsLeftText">Hmm, looks like he also wants an unfinished item, and a finished item. We haven\'t got those yet!</string>
    <string name="tutorialVisitorClose">Close</string>
    <string name="tutorialVisitorCloseText">Let\'s leave the visitor, and make our way to the furnace to make some bronze bars.</string>

    <!-- Stage 5 -->
    <string name="tutorialFurnaceSlots">Slots</string>
    <string name="tutorialFurnaceSlotsText">Any bars that are currently being smelted in the furnace will appear here. If there\'s no space, bars will be queued up.</string>
    <string name="tutorialFurnace">Furnace</string>
    <string name="tutorialFurnaceText">Time to open up the furnace, and make a bar for Mr T Utorial.</string>

    <!-- Stage 6 -->
    <string name="tutorialFurnaceItems">Item</string>
    <string name="tutorialFurnaceItemsText">Item information is shown here. Generally, item information can only be seen after being created, but the bronze bar has been unlocked for you.</string>
    <string name="tutorialFurnaceScroll">Changing Items</string>
    <string name="tutorialFurnaceScrollText">Swiping left and right or tapping the item image will change between available items. For now though, they\'ll mostly be hidden.</string>
    <string name="tutorialFurnaceIngredients">Ingredients</string>
    <string name="tutorialFurnaceIngredientsText">Since this is a rather basic item, it only requires level 1. It also requires copper and tin ore, which we have plenty of.</string>
    <string name="tutorialFurnaceSmelt">Smelting</string>
    <string name="tutorialFurnaceSmeltText">Craft a few bronze bars, we\'ll need them for the unfinished items.</string>
    <string name="tutorialFurnaceClose">Close</string>
    <string name="tutorialFurnaceCloseText">Close the furnace, and we\'ll make our way to the anvil.</string>

    <!-- Stage 7 -->
    <string name="tutorialMainAnvil">Anvil</string>
    <string name="tutorialMainAnvilText">To make the bronze bars into the unfinished dagger, we only need to visit the anvil. As before, notice there\'s only 1 slot available for now.</string>

    <!-- Stage 8 -->
    <string name="tutorialAnvil">Items</string>
    <string name="tutorialAnvilText">As in the furnace, all items are currently hidden except a basic bronze dagger. Luckily, that\'s what we need to make.</string>
    <string name="tutorialAnvilUp">Tiers</string>
    <string name="tutorialAnvilUpText">Unlike the furnace, there are different tiers of item in the anvil. Bronze is the lowest, then iron, all the way up to dragon and legendary items.</string>
    <string name="tutorialAnvilIngredients">Ingredients</string>
    <string name="tutorialAnvilIngredientsText">Hopefully, you\'ve got plenty of bronze bars made from the furnace. If not, better go back and make them!</string>
    <string name="tutorialAnvilCraft">Crafting</string>
    <string name="tutorialAnvilCraftText">Make a couple of unfinished bronze daggers. Notice that you gain XP for every crafted item.</string>

    <!-- Stage 9 -->
    <string name="tutorialMainTable">Table</string>
    <string name="tutorialMainTableText">To turn those unfinished daggers into finished daggers, we need to go to the table.</string>

    <!-- Stage 10 -->
    <string name="tutorialTable">Table</string>
    <string name="tutorialTableText">The table is similar to the anvil, but combines unfinished items and secondary ingredients to make finished items.</string>
    <string name="tutorialTableIngredients">Ingredients</string>
    <string name="tutorialTableIngredientsText">To finish up the dagger, we need a spidersilk. Luckily, we have plenty!</string>
    <string name="tutorialTableCraft">Craft</string>
    <string name="tutorialTableCraftText">Craft one, and the dagger will be ready in a second or so.</string>

    <!-- Stage 11 -->
    <string name="tutorialMainVisitorFinish">Finishing</string>
    <string name="tutorialMainVisitorFinishText">Now, let\'s go give the visitor all of his items.</string>
